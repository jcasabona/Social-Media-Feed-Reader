# Social Media Feed Reader
___________________________________

A simple RSS reader that can read Facebook feeds, Twitter feeds, and normal RSS

## Some Notes

1. The are 3 functions: one for RSS, one for Facebook feeds, and one for Twitter feed
2. You can't access Twitter RSS feeds directly. I'm using a 3rd party service
3. This code needs a cleaning, so please to judge me too hard.
4. *This is released under the MIT License. Do with it what you will.*
